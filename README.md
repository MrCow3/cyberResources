# Cyber Course

## Guided Curriculum

## Linux

* Installing a distro
  * For the purposes of the beginning segment of this course we will be using a distribution called Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a easy to install distribution that can handle all of the basic tasks we will do in the beginning.
  * Ubuntu is a Debian based distro. This means that it will use the APT package manager (We will get into this later on)
  * Eventually we will move onto Kali Linux, Kali is very similar to Ubuntu but comes with tools that we will need when we move onto hacking.

* Understanding Linux Bash Shell
  * Use of Linux is very different than windows, Linux used properly can be the most powerful operating system you will ever use. Understanding the terminal will be the fastest and easiest way to do things on Linux.
  * Bash is the default command shell and is what we will be focusing on during his course.

## Explaining Linux

* Linux by it's self is not a full operating system. Individuals and groups of people create operating systems.
* Operating systems powered by the Linux kernal is extremely decentralized.
  * In general Linux is broken down into a hierachy of operating systems, the two main parent distrubitons: Arch-based and Debian-based.
    * These two main distrobutions use two different package managers. Aptitude (APT) and Pacman.
    * Unlike Windows Downloading programs is not built in to the operating system. Due to this Linux has external package managers. Package managers install programs, delete program and keep up with dependecy changes.

## Living In The Terminal

* Editing text with vi type editors and nano
  * VI type editors are very effective because the mouse is not needed, it is controlled all with keystrokes.
  * VI is a modal editor, it uses three modes: Normal, Insert and Visual. These modes allow you too have triple the amount of key binds each mode for a different type of action you need to do.

  * File management
    * Ranger is the CLI file manger that I go to by default. It uses VI keybindings is very reliable to do anything you need to do. By default it takes some configuration but once it's how you like it, it works really well.

### Bash Scripting

* In Bash and all other Linux shells you can easily create scripts to automate whatever is needed.
* Scripting is just using different command line tools in order to make what you want.
* Pipe
  * The pipe is a very quick and easy way to send the output of a command to the input of the next
* Cron
  * Cron is a time based method of running scripts. Say every day at midnight you want to check for updates, cron is how you do so (I do this by the way).

### Python Scripting

### Web Exploitation

* Password Cracking
* File Upload
* SQL Injection
* Command Injection
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
